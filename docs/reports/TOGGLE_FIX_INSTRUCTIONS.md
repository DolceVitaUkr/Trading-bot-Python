# Toggle Fix Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The dashboard.js file was not being loaded in the HTML page, which is why the toggle clicks weren't working.

## What Was Done

1. **Added dashboard.js to HTML**
   - Added `<script src="/static/dashboard.js?v=1.1"></script>` to dashboard.html
   - This ensures the JavaScript code is actually loaded

2. **Made handleTradingToggle globally accessible**
   - Added `window.handleTradingToggle = handleTradingToggle;`
   - This ensures the function can be called from HTML onclick events

3. **Added debug logging**
   - Console will now show when toggles are clicked
   - Helps diagnose any remaining issues

## How to Test

1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Start it again**: `python start_bot.py`
3. **Open browser**: http://localhost:8000
4. **Force refresh**: Press Ctrl+F5
5. **Open Developer Console**: Press F12
6. **Click a toggle switch**

## What You Should See

1. In the browser console, you should see:
   - "Trading toggle changed: crypto paper true" (when turning on)
   - The toggle should turn green
   - Balance should update
   - Activity log should show "Paper trading started"

2. If you see errors like "handleTradingToggle is not defined":
   - The JavaScript file is still not loading
   - Check the Network tab in Developer Tools

## Troubleshooting

If toggles still don't work:

1. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for red error messages

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Press F12 → Network tab
   - Refresh page
   - Look for dashboard.js - should show status 200

3. **Clear All Browser Data**:
   - Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Clear and restart browser

4. **Try Incognito Mode**:
   - Open new incognito window
   - Navigate to http://localhost:8000
   - Test toggles there
