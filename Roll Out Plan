Paper trade Crypto (Spot by default; Perps/Forex OFF).

Train on live data (15m primary, 5m confirm).

Start paper wallet = $1,000 (segregated “Crypto_Paper”).

Stage 2 – Crypto Live (+ Exploration)

Live trade Crypto with real wallet (uses exchange balance, not $1k stub).

Keep exploration paper trades running (≥10% dynamic).

Canary sizing for first 50 trades or 7 days.

Paper wallets for Perps/Forex remain separate.

Stage 3 – Crypto Live + Perps/Forex Paper

Continue Crypto live (+ exploration).

Start Perps_Paper = $1,000, Forex_Paper = $1,000 (two new segregated paper wallets).

Strategy adapters: allow different params per asset class.

Stage 4 – Crypto & Forex Live (+ Options Paper)

Promote Forex to live (own broker/account, independent from Bybit).

Keep ForexOptions_Paper = $1,000 to incubate options strategy.

Exploration for both Crypto & Forex live.
